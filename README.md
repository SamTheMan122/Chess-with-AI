# Chess - Desktop Chess Game with AI

## About the Project

This version of chess is a full-featured desktop game built using **C#**, **Avalonia UI**, and **XAML**. The application offers an interactive and visually appealing chessboard with click-and-drop piece movement, real-time game validation, and intelligent AI support. One of its core features is an "AI Move" button that suggests and plays the optimal move using a Minimax tree search algorithm.

Key Features:
- Modern UI built with Avalonia and XAML
- Full rule enforcement (including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion)
- Smart AI opponent with configurable difficulty (Minimax-based)
- Game reset, move highlighting, and undo support
